## Description

This week, I was tasked in connecting an application that was created to write and save notes with a backend tool, known as Express JS. Where the frontend code of this application was provided, I was tasked in connnection those code with my backend code so they can react with the requests (GET, POST, and DELETE) and implements an imitation database using a JSON file to store and retrieve data.
